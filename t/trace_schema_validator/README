These JSON schemas[1] can be used to validate trace2 event objects. They
can be used to add regression tests to verify that the event output
format does not change unexpectedly.

Four versions of the schema are provided:
* event_schema.json is more permissive. It verifies that all expected
  fields are present in a trace event, but it allows traces to have
  unexpected additional fields. This allows the schema to be specified
  more concisely by factoring out the common fields into a reusable
  sub-schema.
* strict_schema.json is more restrictive. It verifies that all expected
  fields are present and no unexpected fields are present in the trace
  event. Due to this additional restriction, the common fields cannot be
  factored out into a re-usable subschema (at least as-of draft-07) [2],
  and must be repeated for each event definition.
* list_schema.json is like event_schema.json above, but validates a JSON
  array of trace events, rather than a single event.
* strict_list_schema.json is like strict_schema.json above, but
  validates a JSON array of trace events, rather than a single event.
